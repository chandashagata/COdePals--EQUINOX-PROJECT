# EQUINOX-PROJECT
Our Team COdePals has created the Project- Student Result Management Systems. 

We were motivated to create this project as Handling Result, Personal Details, Course Details and many more such data, comes as a task for us in our daily lives, being students in college or any Educational Institutions. 
There is a need of Secured Data management System to be used in Every other institution to avoid thefts, fraud, authentication defects etc.

Our Project has been created using Python(to create the GUI-Graphical User Interface) and MySQL( to store vast amount of data).
This Project helped us a learn a lot of concepts of Graphical User Interface and Database Management along with good Team work skills and Coordinating Skills. It was a new experience but an amazing and interesting one. We learned about many new modules, database structures, and Collective Coding together.

Our Project has many different and unique features that would help the users in all tasks, whether its an User Interactive Interface, Security, Vast data storages and many more such features. 
Do take a look at our Project and best wishes from Team COdePals.
